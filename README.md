# DACs_Screening_for_CO2RR_using_ML

This repo holds the source data and codes for the research paper entitled `TBC`

## How to use

To reproduce the results, you need using python3 and relevant packages including `pytorch`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` etc.
You can build up the environment for this repo and reproduce the results following the steps:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

    Alternatively, you can firstly install python (version 3.8) and then use `pip` to install necessary packages.

2. Clone this repository to your local disk:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/755452800/DACs_Screening_for_CO2RR_using_ML.git
```

3. Change to the project directory, create the python environment and activate the environment:

```bash
cd DACs_Screening_for_CO2RR_using_ML
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate DACs_Screening
```

Alternatively, you can use `pip` to install packages to build the environment after installing python:

```bash
cd DACs_Screening_for_CO2RR_using_ML
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Check the source data and codes and run the scripts under the `DACs_Screening` environment to reproduce the results.

*Note that `plt.show()` in the scripts is a blocking function, so you need manually close the figures to continue if you're running the scripts in a terminal.*
